=head1 NAME

ConvertWinmailDat - Extract Attachments from winmail.dat

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sometimes Outlook attaches a winmail.dat file that contains the original attachment(s). That file
is encoded in a proprietary format and with an other mail client than Outlook, you won't be able
to get the original attachment(s).

This OTRS plugin is implemented as a PostMaster filter that checks if an incoming mail has a
file named winmail.dat attached. If such an attachment is found, the original attachments
are extracted and added to the article. However the winmail.dat attachment is still attached
to the article.

There is nothing to do after installation.

=head1 INSTALLATION

You can install this package with the built-in OTRS package manager (in the Admin area) or
on command line:
